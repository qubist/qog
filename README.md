# Quest for the Ojeran Gemerald

My first text based adventure game in which you, an adventurer, explore the depths of a dangerous dungeon in order to find the fabled Ojeran Gemerald.

Inspired by the good old (and I mean *old*) text based game, *Zork*

## Background

I built this game in 2013 as part of my ClojureScript website back then: "[The Nebula](github.com/qubist/the-nebula)". In 2021, inspired by my new website's URL [will.quest](https://will.quest), I updated the game to run more easily in the command-line and also created a [Replit](https://replit.com/@qubist/qog) so it can be played online.

Playing with a pad of paper and a pencil nearby might be helpful.

## Play online

You can now play Quest for the Ojeran Gemerald online on [Replit](https://replit.com/@qubist/qog).

1. Go to https://replit.com/@qubist/qog and click "Run"

Game instructions are provided on launch.

## Install and play locally

1. Clone this repo
2. Install [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) and [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/#install)

From the `qog` directory, use Leiningen to start the game:

```bash
lein run
```
